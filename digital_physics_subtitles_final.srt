I think we need to invest in a printer.

What do we need that for?

20
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,667
I thought we could print out some of the
programs and sell them at the merch table

21
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,625
or maybe use them as inserts 
for the next album.

I've got one of mine that's going to

Oh, that. I'm sorry. I just had to
run a few programs, that's all.

Programs. You mean computer?

135
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:16,125
Well, yeah... I did a systematic search of
all these three-bit, one-dimensional, cell

only 256 of them, so it's manageable.

00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:53,000
No, but I've lived here for three years,
so I know how things operate.

to print out and it's all yours.

156
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:35,667
Okay, so this is rule 244,
or 11110100 in binary.

157
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,625
So I printed off the first page which has
the beginning of the program here,

158
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,792
and then a portion of the output
around 10,000 steps in. 

159
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,542
Up top are the rules.
For the initial conditions,

160
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,208
I set all the cells to off
except the one in the middle there.

161
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:53,292
Okay, simple initial conditions,
simple rules... simple result?

162
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,875
No. Look at this complexity.

163
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:02,417
But wouldn't you expect with such a simple
rule we'd get boring, predictable results?

164
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,750
I don't know.

165
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:08,167
I mean, that's what I thought. Then I saw
rule 120. That's what brought me here.

166
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,167
I thought it was a mistake, but it's not.
I checked it on the computer. And after

167
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:18,625
I saw it was a real computational
phenomenon, I had to run all 256 programs

168
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:23,042
of the same type last night. And then I
ran into this one. And now I'm thinking

169
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,542
that maybe other simple programs
also exhibit this phenomenon.

170
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,542
It's not just these three-bit
cell progression programs.

171
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,333
Well, I...

172
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm not sure if I understand what you're
saying, but it sounds interesting.

173

It's going to take too long.

00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,375
You use this computer long?
I want to check my grades.

177
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,208
Oh, ahh, okay.

178
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll just pick these up later.

[printer printing]

180
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,583
The school sends you one of those 
electronic messages with your grades?

181
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:22,250
No, I use a password to log into 
university's network. 

182
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,250
Really?

183
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:28,708
Yes, since this hostel is associated with
the university's exchange program, this

184
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,750
computer is connected to their network.

185
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,500
This computer is part of 
City Tech's network?

186
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:38,583
Yeah. It's one of only a couple of 
computers that is off campus.

187
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:44,292
Man, things have changed since I was there
and we just had the one mainframe.

188
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,458
Well, don't let me hold you up.

189
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,417
I've got the password.

190
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,292
What?

191
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,625
The password to get on Tech's network.
It's time for some parallel computing.

192
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:05,875
What you talk about?

193
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,792
I figured out a way to check
all these other simple programs.

194
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,250
It turns out tech's got this
network of connected computers

195
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,958
that beats the pants off the mainframe
they had when I was there.

196
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,375
You went to City Tech?

197
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,750
Yeah, it was a while ago.

198
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,500
That's a great school.
What did you study?

199
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:24,542
Computers, symbolic systems, mathematics,
a little physics...

00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,583
[French] That sound is annoying.

213
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,708
All right, just...

214
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,333
Excuse me.

215
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:58,375

My other film is showing here on Sunday.
Perhaps you'll be here?

229
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,833
Ummm...

230
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,833
Possibly.

231
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:52,708
Excusez-moi, do you know why the

[computer dings and beeping stops]

233
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,250
I'm sorry. Some of the travelers were 
complaining about the noise so I put the

234
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,375
blanket over it to make it quieter.

235
00:26:58,458 --> 00:26:59,417
Is it broken?

236
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,333
No, no, no. I was just running
something. It's done now.

237
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,542
[French] Okay, never mind. 

238
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,125
Excuse me one moment.

239
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,167
Listen, I have to ask you, you are able
to call the band just for to confirm that

240
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,542
they have correct address and 
they are sending the check? 

241
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,958
They're sending it. I mean,
they have the address here. 

242
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:20,167
I have no way of getting in touch with
them, so I can't prove it to you.

243
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,250
Well, when is their next performance?

244
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:27,000
I forget. It's in a little 
seaport south of here.

245
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,542
And the name of this band, it is...?

246
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,083
Why? You don't think they exist? 

247
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:32,750
That's...

You want?

262
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,792
I better not. I got to wake up early in
the morning before everyone gets in here

I think it's universal.

288
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,667
Look at these programs. Rewrite systems,
two-dimensional cell progressions,

They all exhibit it.

system. It just arises.

Why do you care?
Why is it important?

Because it doesn't make sense and it
should. You know, the real world is a

thereof... It's a miserable place.

I am joking. But ah, really, it's true.

They call film the moving image
but it never really does.

318
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:57,000
It only gives the illusion.

I just realized something huge.

Maybe math isn't as general as we think.

399
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,792
Maybe the math that we use to describe
physics is just the path that human

400
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,125
civilizations just happen to take.

401
00:46:39,292 --> 00:46:40,208
What?

402
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:43,583
I'm finding lots of systems where
complexity emerges out of very simple

403
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:47,708
programs, things that look like
snowflakes, fluid turbulence, 

404
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:51,208
animal patterns, flocks of birds, DNA, 
physics, biology, nature.

405
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:55,375
Maybe you can't reconcile the world with
calculus and continuous mathematics.

406
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:56,208
What?

407
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:59,417
Maybe there's one bit of small code, and
all this richness in the world

408
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,333
is just a consequence.

409
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:02,292
A program?

410
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:05,125
But it has to be simple and elegant.
It has to be highly compressed

411
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:08,125
in order to encapsulate all the
physical laws and complexity of biology.

412
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:11,000
It probably won't even be recognizable
at that level of compression.

I'm taking back the beer.

414
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:20,375
Occam's Razor. Lex parsimoniae. Scientists
are always looking for the most simple

415
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:24,125
and elegant ways to describe phenomena.
Seemingly disparate ideas get unified

416
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,167
and integrated into a common theory that
are explained as sets of mathematical

417
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,292
equations. It's a similar idea, but
I'm looking for the most simple program

418
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:36,375
that explains it all. Maybe it's just a
few lines recursively executed.

419
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:37,875
A few... A few lines of code?

420
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:42,500
Sure, the idea is to minimize the input,
the program, and maximize the richness

421
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:48,125
of the output. The rules should always be
simpler than what they describe, or else

422
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:51,875
there's always a reason, the reason 
itself, like adding axioms to deal

423
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:54,375
with incompleteness in mathematics. It's 
the equivalent of someone saying "just 

424
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:59,083
because" when asked for a reason. Have 
you ever heard a Lagrangian interpolation?

425
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,292
What do you think, huh?

426
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,208

427
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:14,500
Can I borrow that?

428
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,792
Yes...

429
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,167
Shit.

430
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,375
I'm, I'm not sure I...

431
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:31,458
Fuck it, all right. My point was you might
think this splattering of dots was random,

432
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,917
but there's always an equation of a line
that goes through these points, and

433
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,208
there's always a theory that explains the
results. So there's always a reason.

434
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:41,708
There's always a law if you allow them to
be so complicated. So what one strives for

435
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:46,708
is an elegant explanation. If it's not
small, simple, elegant, compressed, the

436
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:49,042
notion of a physical law becomes vacuous.

437
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:53,125
Hey-o, are you done with my pen?

438
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:58,333
So while traditional physicists are 
looking for elegant mathematical formulas

439
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:02,667
based on differential equations, the 
infinitesimal, continuous mathematics

440
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,000
such as calculus, I'm looking for the 
one piece of digital code that explains

441
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:11,208
the universe. No measurement has ever been
taken with an infinite level of precision.

442
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,417
A digital, finite, discrete universe.

443
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:18,417
It's going to be a whole
new direction for science.

00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,500
You've lost me... I... Maybe I'm just...

445
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:27,417
The problem is radical ideas like this
only get published and taken seriously if

446
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,292
they come from someone within the
establishment, someone with 

447
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:33,875
some credibility. You know what I'm 
saying? And I know just the guy.

complexity. He also won the Nobel Prize

incompleteness theorem.

the physics realm.

it's a rather simple and elegant code so

when we start with the shortest programs
and check them in order of complexity,

hopefully it won't take forever.

Of course, there's the question of how 
many steps will I need to run the program?

And how many steps will it take for me to
know that it's our universe or not?

Most of the network computers haven't

They're running something but they're
not producing any output.

I wrote code that was supposed to check
that. It was supposed to check to see if a

eventually come to a... halt.

524
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:15,292
Turing basically showed that there is no
easy and systematic approach to see if a

525
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:18,583

running forever until you had to start

It's directly tied in with GÃ¶del's
incompleteness theorem.

528
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:27,833
Okay, here's a proof by contradiction:

529
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,875
Let's just suppose there was an algorithm
you could write to check to see if a given

530
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:34,292
program was going to stop. Then suppose
the algorithm was checking the program 

531
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:37,083
that essentially said something 
like the following: 

532
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:40,333
If the Riemann hypothesis is true--of 
course we would explicitly write this out

533
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:46,125
in a mathematical way--then do some output
and stop. Else, the Riemann hypothesis is

534
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:51,417
flase, do some loop. Of course, I'm 
assuming the Riemann hypothesis is one of

535
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:55,625
the true and unprovable statements under
the current axioms of mathematics.

00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:56,625

00:56:56,708 --> 00:57:00,708

539
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:05,458
The task of searching for the code
that'll be the code for our universe.

540
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:08,333
This shows that there is no easy and
systematic approach to just look through

Doctor um...?

Maybe it's useless anyway. Maybe these

He's Greek.

648
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:38,292
Yeah. Okay, just let me explain.

649
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:42,542
You start with a list of the positive 
integers. Then you apply this very simple

650
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:45,958
rule to start eliminating all the numbers.
The numbers that don't get eliminated are

651
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:51,083
defined as the primes. But you know, a
physicist looking at something that

652
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:55,042
generated prime numbers in nature would
probably us a formula like n/log(n) to

653
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:59,417
make predictions. They would say something
like, "Look how statistically accurate the

654
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:04,042
model is. We can get it so close to the 
right answer. Only off by two parts 

655
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:06,667
in a trillion. It has to be right."

656
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,167
It is not?

657
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,917
No. The primes aren't statistical. 
They're not probabilistic.

658
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,292
They're determined ahead of time. Remember
the sieve I was just telling you about?

Erat... uh... Erat-

660
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:23,167

the primes. It's a simple rule, a simple

661
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,375
process, a simple program. 
It's deterministic.

662
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:31,000
You know, a physicist's statistical
approach for making predictions about the

663
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:34,958
primes might be quicker and highly
accurate, but it's not the reality.

could find the code, maybe it won't tell

anyone ask in a long time.

688
01:11:00,042 --> 01:11:02,958
I just joking.

[sighing]

690
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:16,583
Let me know if you have any problems.

691
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:23,000
Hey.

692
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:24,625
Hey.

693
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:26,625
How you feeling?

694
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:28,208
Okay.

695
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:31,083
Can I sit?

696
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:38,875
I found this downstairs by the check-in.

697
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:43,625
I mean, give me a break. Are you serious?

698
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,500
What?

699
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:49,500
[mumbling]

700
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:53,500
Are you kidding...

701
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:55,625
What?

702
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:57,917
This isn't for me.

703
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,167
Why do you say that? 

704
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:02,125
Look, if you want me to take a 
leap of faith, at least let there  

705
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:03,917
be plausible evidence.

706
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,333
I mean, if you ask me to believe in the
Riemann hypothesis, I'd say, okay, I don't

707
01:12:07,417 --> 01:12:12,167
know if it's true or not, but I'll take
your word, I'll go on faith. But this?

708
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,042
I'm just worried about you.

709
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:16,708
I'm through with drugs.

710
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:20,625
I'm glad to hear that, but
it's not just that, you know?

711
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,042
Do you think I'm crazy?

712
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,958
I never say that.

713
01:12:24,042 --> 01:12:25,125
Well, then what?

714
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:29,125
Khatchig, you spend all your time on
whatever it is you're working on, but

715
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,792
with nothing to show.

716
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:39,542
No money, wearing the same stained shirt,
living off croissants and sausages you

717
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:45,875
stash away... not taking care of 
yourself... it's no way to live, Khatchig.

718
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:49,750
It's not sustainable.

719
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,375
You know...

720
01:12:54,583 --> 01:13:00,375
It's not about money, or a big
house, or two and half kids, 

721
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:03,375
or whatever else makes
you happy. You know?

722
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:07,667
It's not always a straight path.

723
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:10,917
You know, maybe this is the level
I should be living at.

724
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,875
You know, the level that 
makes me the happiest.

725
01:13:14,042 --> 01:13:18,000
Are you happy?

726
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:24,083
No... not really.

727
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:27,125
Look... look, I appreciate it.

728
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:32,792
I appreciate your concern. I'll be okay.

729
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,042
I'll go get you some water. Okay?

01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:03,000
I know. Me too.

Does he have any family?

734
01:14:05,417 --> 01:14:07,583
I don't know.

735
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:14,583
We need to get him away from this 
work of his for a little bit.

736
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:17,958
I mean, it isn't good to be so obsessed.

737
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:21,750
What do you suggest?

738
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:26,500
I don't know. Fresh air?

Venice is supposed to be visible

741
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:45,292
Do you think there is life out there? 
Intelligent life?

742
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:50,375
I don't know. But I think I will feel
even more alone if there was.

743
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:52,375
Why?

744
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:59,000
I guess it would just make me feel
more insignificant. I don't know.

745
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:04,292
It might be the mood I'm in.
I think traveling has this effect on me.

746
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,708
You ever heard of the Drake equation?

747
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:08,958
I don't think so.

748
01:15:10,042 --> 01:15:12,417
It's the formula that estimates 
how many planets with intelligent 

749
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,750
life are in our galaxy.

750
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:18,792
Some people have estimated that there are
thousands of intelligent civilizations

751
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:22,458
in the Milky Way alone, but it relies on
a lot of things such as how many planets

752
01:15:22,542 --> 01:15:25,958
are in our galaxy that are suitable for
life, the probability that life arises on

753
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:30,625
those planets, the conditional probability
that given life has arisen, the chance

754
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:36,000
that intelligent life capable of
producing technology emerges.

755
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:40,542
But the most suspect variable in the whole
equation is a fraction of a planet's

756
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:44,375
lifetime that's marked by an intelligent
civilization.

757
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:49,375
Because soon after intelligent life
emerges, it destroys itself with its 

758
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,833
own technology.

759
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:56,667
So there is no one else out there.

760
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:01,458
It's probably hopeless. Just like
the current state of physics.

761
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:08,125
I mean, hasn't anyone heard of Zeno's
paradox? Reductio ad absurdum?

762
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:12,542
Digital physics is the only real hope we
have for absolute truth. Without it,

763
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:16,333
all we can hope to know is finite bits
in an infinite abyss.

01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:19,125
The infinitesimal. 

765
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,125
Do you believe it? Because I don't.

766
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:32,708
It's just an idea, and I find very 
little evidence to support it.

767
01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:36,667
Did you ever hear the joke about
the philosophers having dinner?

768
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,500
No.

01:16:42,625 --> 01:16:47,375
Philosophers having dinner when one 
notices the other one is not.

He, he just looks at, at his food.

771
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:55,875
Philosopher says, "Why don't you eat your
dinner?" And the other philosopher says,

772
01:16:55,958 --> 01:17:01,375
"Because I'm not sure it exists."
"What?", he says.

773
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:06,375
"I only see the light reflects off the 
food, and not the food itself. So,

774
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:08,875
so how can I be sure it exists?"

775
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:14,000
Well, the philosopher had no 
answer, but he enjoyed his food.

776
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:18,875
And the philosopher who did not know that
the light reflects off the food entering

777
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:28,917
his eye implies the existence of the food
falls to the wayside due to hunger.

778
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,958
That joke really doesn't have a punchline,
and I'm not sure I get your point.

779
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:34,750
My point: What does any of this 
matter, huh?

780
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:39,125
You think too much about all this nonsense
and you're the one who will be falling

curvature in some of these results.

Ummm...

And special relativity holds too. Everyone
measures the same speed for light.

801
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,667
And these tangles in the network could be
matter. It's all just information.

But, but the world is made of atoms, 
not points on a computer.

804

Well, this emergent phenomena might
just be the result of what's below

Did you ever think of that?

806

Of course not. I have no
idea what you talk about.

807

So who made the code? God?

808
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:08,208
Maybe. But maybe god's this high 
school kid in a parallel universe.

we may just be helping to compute ten to

reproduced Einstein's equations out of

01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,958
out of almost nothing. General and special
relativity out of something so simple, 

814

so elegant, it has to be right.
Don't you understand?

Not really.

816
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:30,833
So, so you found the program?

817
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:36,042
Well, no, but...
I found the class of programs.

818
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,208
If you take a node in these systems
and count the number of nodes that are

819
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:43,167
one node away, two nodes away, three nodes
away, etc. You know, that number grows at

820
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:46,417

01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:05,417
Hello, hello.

854
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,042
Hello. How can I help you?

855
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:11,375
I need to get in contact with Dr. Mercury
Jhaitin. Do you have his address?

856
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:13,667
Are you the one who called earlier?

857
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,458
No.

858
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:21,542
Well, I can't give you that information,
but if you give me a second

859
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:25,167
I can give you his name for
sending an electronic message.

860
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,458
I already sent him an electronic message,
and I doubt he checks it during the

861
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:31,958
summer. I need his address. I really
need to speak with him. It's urgent.

862
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:35,625
I'm not allowed to give out 
faculty addresses.

863
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:38,167
Well, don't you have it 
here in the computer?

864
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:41,500
I can't give out faculty addresses.

865
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:44,458
Fine, fine.

866
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:46,167
Well, do you have any literature on
physics classes you're offering 

867
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,458
here in the fall?

868
01:23:48,542 --> 01:23:51,750
I have a catalog with course descriptions?

869
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:55,917
Yeah, that'll do. I was
thinking about taking one.

870
01:23:56,417 --> 01:24:00,167
All right, just a minute.

01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:45,625
Sorry... Hello? What? 

880
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:50,667
Okay, hold on. Could you 
go find Jacqueline?

881
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:54,333
Cause there's some guy from some band 
who said he had a message to call her.

882
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:55,458
Okay.

883
01:24:55,542 --> 01:24:58,333
Thank you.

884
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:09,625
Hello, Dr. Jhaitin? Yes, this is the 
admin office. I'm sorry to bother you

885
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:11,167
but this is really important.

Yes, Yes, I am trying to figure
out which train should I take.

888
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:35,917
Okay... Okay.

889
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:41,042
[Dutch] Mister.

890
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:46,458
Jacqueline needs to talk to you.

891
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:48,625
Just give me a little bit 
more time. I've got it.

892
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:54,417
Uhhh... Fu-, I'm sorry.
I got to go. I can't...

Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

896
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:23,333
Shh. It's all right, buddy.
I'm just here to talk some shop.

897
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:26,500
It's okay. I got something for you.

898
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:31,833
You see it? You see the sausage?
Huh? You see it?

899
01:26:31,917 --> 01:26:35,750
Go get it.

900
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:48,250
I'm in.

902
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,667
Oh, no.

903
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,250
What is that?

904
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:05,000
Oh, I think it's what that
phone call was about.

906
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:19,917
How did you get in here?

907
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,333
Just hear me out.

[dog barking and scratching]

909
01:27:23,208 --> 01:27:25,708
Oh my god. Do you want 
me to call the police?

910
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:31,542
No, it's all right. Isn't it?

911
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:37,458
After all, I'm sure he's aware that
I didn't win the Nobel Peace Prize.

912
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:43,542
Just give us a minute.

913

[dog yelp]

916
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:58,000
Thank you, Dr. Jhaitin. My name is-

917
01:27:58,083 --> 01:28:00,708
I know who you are.

918
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:08,208
You're the one who sent me
your computer programs. 

919
01:28:08,292 --> 01:28:09,250
You got them?

920
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:11,583
Of course I got them. All of them.

921
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:12,583
Well, I wasn't sure-

922
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:16,875
I even printed out the programs
you sent me. They're right here.

923
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:20,208
Well, I just wasn't sure... I know
my work isn't very well organized.

924
01:28:20,292 --> 01:28:22,542
It's not very well developed either.

925
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:24,333
Not developed?

926
01:28:24,417 --> 01:28:28,375
Aren't you the one that broke the 
particle accelerator at the university

927
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:32,042
a few years back?
I knew I recognized the name.

928
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,375
That wasn't intentional.

929
01:28:34,458 --> 01:28:37,500
A lot of people in the physics
department were quite upset.

930
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:41,042
It set them back nearly two years.

931
01:28:41,667 --> 01:28:47,500
So, what is it that you want
to discuss that couldn't wait?

932
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:50,583
Well, I wanted to discuss my work.

933
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:52,667
That's why you broke into my house?

934
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:57,500
That's why you nearly gave my wife a 
heart attack? Because of your work?

935
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm sorry, but I'm staying at this hostel,
and they're going to kick me out,

936
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:05,417
and I've nowhere else to go. And then,
then this work I'm doing...

937
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:09,042
I don't know if anyone else could 
appreciate, you know, not without a

938
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:11,000
computer, math or physics background.

939
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:13,083
Well, don't you see the 
implications of what I'm getting at?

940
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:14,500
What are you talking about?

941
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:17,042
I'm talking about my work, those programs.

942
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:19,167
What about them?

943
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:23,208
Well, did you even look at them? Did you
even read my notes, my work, my theories?

944
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:25,833
I mean, this could be a whole new 
direction for science to go in. 

945
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:28,417
This isn't science. It's speculation.

946
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,125
It's evidence.

947
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:30,958
I mean, look at it.

948
01:29:31,042 --> 01:29:34,667
Are you telling me that time and space
emerging out of an even simpler concept

949
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:37,708
is just some sort of parlor trick,
just some sort of novelty act

950
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,417
you can impress ladies with at a party?

951
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:43,250
What kind of party would 
you be showing this at?

952
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:47,417
I mean, I reproduce general and special
relativity out of almost nothing.

953
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,667
Did you even look at my work?

954
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:52,708
Great. A model with space, but it 
has no notion of matter.

955
01:29:52,792 --> 01:29:54,542
And unfortunately, we live 
in a universe that has matter

956
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:59,250
and dark matter and anti-matter.

957
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:01,458
But matter could just be
like tangles in the network.

958
01:30:01,542 --> 01:30:05,875
I don't think you understand
how science is performed.

959
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:06,792
What? 

960
01:30:06,875 --> 01:30:10,708
I'm serious. Your theories totally
ignore the scientific method.

961
01:30:10,792 --> 01:30:12,667
What are you talking about?

962
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:16,500
I'm talking about the way science
has been performed for millennia.

963
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:21,500
You observe phenomena. You come up with
a theory to explain the phenomena. You

964
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:25,292
deduce what some of the implications of
this theory are, what the predictions are.

965
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:27,875
You test your theory against experiments.

966
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:30,833
If the experiments are consistent
with what the theory predicts,

967
01:30:30,917 --> 01:30:35,375
this lends credence to your theory.
If not, you look for a new theory.

968
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:40,208
Well, that's the thing. Many things can't
be predicted. That's what I was saying.

969
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:44,042
You can't make precise predictions
on simple, deterministic systems.

970
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:47,667
It's like GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem.
There's no way to out-compute the system.

971
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:48,917
This isn't the same.

972
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,167
Do you know what Kurt GÃ¶del once 
said when someone at the Institute

973
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,792
for Advanced Study introduced 
himself as an astrophysicist?

974
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:55,000
Enlightened me.

975
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:57,542
GÃ¶del told him he didn't believe in the
natural sciences. He believed that the

976
01:30:57,625 --> 01:31:00,375
nature of reality could be described
a priori, without the need for experience

977
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:01,583
or empirical evidence.

978
01:31:01,667 --> 01:31:04,417
He also starved himself to death 
because he thought people

979
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,417
were trying to poison him.

980
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:10,333
You're gonna tell me that this 
is how the world works?

981
01:31:10,417 --> 01:31:14,333
No, these are just the symbols that 
humans have come up with to describe the 

982
01:31:14,417 --> 01:31:16,167
phenomena. Math is a human construct.

983
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,958
Some people would argue the contrary.
They'd say that math is discovered, that

984
01:31:20,042 --> 01:31:22,417
it has always existed, 
from the beginning of time,

985
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,125
in every corner of the universe.

986
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:28,000
We are just beginning to understand more
and more about it with each generation.

987
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:33,500
The real world is just information, bits
interacting, and what emerges, the

988
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:37,375
consequences, those are the physical laws,
and we describe it with this language

989
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,708
we've made up called mathematics.

990
01:31:39,792 --> 01:31:42,083
Your model is deterministic.

991
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:46,167
You're trying to tell me there's
no such thing as free will? It is written?

992
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:49,167
Apparently, you're not a 
Lawrence of Arabia fan.

993
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,750
But there's no to know exactly-

994
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:53,917
Where is quantum mechanics in your theory?
Where is Bell's inequality?

995
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,625
Where is quantum field theory and
the random, probabilistic nature

996
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:59,417
that we can show over 
and over in experiments?

997
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:04,083
It isn't randomness. It's complexity, 
irreducible complexity.

998
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:07,083
Nothing is random. Einstein was right.
God doesn't play dice.

999
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:09,417
So we should just rewrite thermodynamics?

1000
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:13,375
Sure statistics and probabilities may be
our best tool at making predictions

1001
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:16,292
because the complexity of the system is
just so overwhelming there's no way to

1002
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:19,750
get to the final answer without
just letting it all play out.

1003
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:22,292
But that doesn't mean these statistical
approaches are fundamental rules that 

1004
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:23,333
govern the universe.

1005
01:32:23,417 --> 01:32:25,250
It's scientific heresy.

1006
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:28,625
So what? So was the notion of the earth 
orbiting the sun at one point.

1007
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:32,125
It's useless. You cannot put a man on the
moon with your science. You can't make

1008
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:36,042
transistors with your science.
If you want to make progress-

1009
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:40,750
You know, I used to look up to you 
for challenging conventional wisdom,

1010
01:32:40,833 --> 01:32:44,625
but since you got your ideas out there,
you want it all to just stay the same.

1011
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:48,625
My work was building upon other 
people's work who came before me.

1012
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:52,000
You're looking to rewrite all of 
science. Advancements are made in

1013
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:54,125
little increments.

1014
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:57,208
I'm calling the police.

1015
01:32:57,292 --> 01:33:00,167
Don't bother. I'm out of here.

1016
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:05,167
[security alarm beep and door closing]

1017
01:33:14,917 --> 01:33:17,417
[security alarm beep and door closing]

1018
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,750
Wait. 

1019
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:27,375
You show a lot of promise. You should
consider coming back to university

1020
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:28,958
to finish your degree.

1021
01:33:29,042 --> 01:33:31,833
If you really want to be taken seriously
in the scientific community, if you want

1022
01:33:31,917 --> 01:33:38,083
to make a contribution, you have to
learn the standard model of physics.

1023
01:33:38,167 --> 01:33:42,375
Particle physics is an interesting world.
They're building the world's biggest

1024
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:46,292
particle accelerator. Maybe you could 
help discover a new particle.

1025
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:47,750
A new particle?

1026
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:51,625
Did you read anything I sent you,
you patronizing bastard?

1027
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:56,625
[grunting]

1028
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:07,625
[somber music]

1029
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:31,667
[traffic passing and crickets chirping]

1030
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:41,667
[cans rattling]

1031
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:48,042
[somber music continues]
[projetor clicks, dog barks, bird chirps]

1032
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:55,042
[dog splashing]

1033
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:08,042
[dog barking, feet clomping]

1034
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:29,792
What's that jerk doing?

1035
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:32,083
Shhh...

1036
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:35,958
Well, I think Jacqueline booked your bed.

1037
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:39,708
Why did she do that?
She booked Lana's bed as well?

1038
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:41,917
Sssshhhh...

1039
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,583
You mean that girl that was here?

1040
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:44,167
Yeah.

1041
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:47,875
Yeah, I saw her packing her bags.
I think she left earlier today.

1042
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:50,125
What do you mean?

1043
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:54,500
You know she was going to a different
town. Oh, which reminds me,

1044
01:36:54,583 --> 01:36:58,875
Maxxie, from 2-B, he left a couple
beers on your tab before he left.

1045
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:01,750
He said he knew you.

1046
01:37:01,833 --> 01:37:03,042
You serious?

1047
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:04,583
[Dutch] Of course. 

1048
01:37:04,667 --> 01:37:06,667
Why would I make this up?

1049
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:09,583
You lied to me. 

1050
01:37:11,167 --> 01:37:14,167
There was never any check. 

1051
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:17,792
I want you out.

1052
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,792
Okay.

1053
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:34,792
[suitcase opening]

1054
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:51,875
Honey, are you coming for dinner?

1055
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:54,375
I'll be there in a second.

1056
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:57,375
[thunder rolling]

1057
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:21,708
[record needle drops]

1058
01:38:24,042 --> 01:38:26,708
Do you want to dance?

1059
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:37,833
Did you like the film?

1060
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:41,375
Best film ever.

1061
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:05,958
[thunder rolling]

1062
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:16,000
Honey, your dinner is going to get cold.

1063
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:18,375
Okay.

1064
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:20,833
Okay.

1065
01:39:33,917 --> 01:39:38,042
Honey... What?

1066
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:41,125
No, it's...

1067
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:44,250
I don't know.

1068
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:04,042
[splashes, rain, thunder]

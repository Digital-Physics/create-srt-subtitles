This is a file that converts subtitles or Closed Captions from a .txt format to a .srt format. If you can get Adobe or another program to give you a txt format that isn't numbered (like .srt), this might be an easier format to clean up before converting to .srt using this code.

There's also code that can be used for shifting time codes for added or deleted scenes made after the text CC is already generated.

There's also a version of the .txt to .srt code that stretches the timecodes. This was created because the timecode in Quicktime which the .txt Closed Captions were based on did not match the duration of the file.

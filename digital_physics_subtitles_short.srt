1
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,500
Wait.

2
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,583
I think we need to invest in a printer.

3
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:47,208
What do we need that for?

4
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,250
I thought we could print out some of the programs

5
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,458
and sell them at the merch table

6
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,417
or maybe use them as inserts for the next album.

7
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,458
Plus, we're going to need a faster computer.

8
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,167
I've got one of mine

9
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,500
that's going to give us enough juice to be able

10
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,417
to run all the visualization programs we need.

11
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:00,208
Speaking of which, I don't know

12
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,500
if you saw what happened out there-

13
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,458
Listen dude, I don't even want to know.

14
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,417
The band needs to conserve money.

15
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,958
We can't just keep paying for computer expenses.

16
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,667
But this is important.

17
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,167
There's something very weird going on here.

18
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,917
It's very counterintuitive.

19
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:14,042
Listen dude,

20
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,292
we can't just fund your computer hobby.

21
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:17,458
We got to do what makes sense for the band

22
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,625
and our music's the main focus.

23
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,708
So what are you saying?

24
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,458
Listen dude, we’ll

25
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,833
try to scrape some money together

26
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,167
to get some replacement parts

27
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,125
but we can’t just get a whole new computer

28
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,042
or a printer.

29
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,083
We barely have enough money

30
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:37,875
to get from gig to gig.

31
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:48,917
Hello?

32
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:55,375
Yes, I'm calling for a bed tonight.

33
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:55,958
You're ad says you

34
00:05:55,958 --> 00:06:01,917
have a computer?

35
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,667
I'm on the east side of the city right now,

36
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,750
so I won't be there till later.

37
00:06:04,750 --> 00:08:51,333
What's the best way to get there?

38
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:57,000
Ok

39
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,292
Hi.

40
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,167
How can I help you?

41
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,167
I called earlier today about a bed.

42
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,667
And how many nights will you be staying with us?

43
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,375
Indefinitely.

44
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,708
Indefinitely?

45
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,708
Voila.

46
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:38,833
Your bed is the left top bunk.

47
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:46,708
There she is.

48
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,708
L'ordinateur?

49
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,458
The computer

50
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,708
is only available a little while longer.

51
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,292
Hey, what you got going on here?

52
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,833
Appalachian Trail.

53
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,750
Hmm?

54
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,708
You will let me know when the check arrives?

55
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:12,583
Umhmm.

56
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,750
Sergey, just for to let you know I let the guy

57
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,167
stay in the left top bunk in the lounge

58
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:19,250
Just for a couple of days.

59
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,917
Just until he gets paid.

60
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,083
Ok, but you know what happened the last

61
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,042
time you were so generous, right?

62
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:24,833
I know. I know.
